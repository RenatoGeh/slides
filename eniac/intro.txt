Self-Driving with Sum-Product Networks

Abstract: Sum-product networks (SPNs) are part of a class of probabilistic graphical models said to be tractable. Inference is computable in time linear to the graph's size, making SPNs a promising model for applications that require real-time predictions. Amongst the many subtasks of self-driving is lane-tracking, in which the agent (e.g. a car) must be able to maintain the vehicle within lane boundaries, making the appropriate corrections when needed. In this presentation, we show how such a task can be accomplished in a downsized, hardware constrained version of autonomous driving on a mobile robot setting, using image classification as a form of imitation learning to guide the agent. Our results show that SPNs are capable of generalizing training data fairly well, even when the training sample size is small. Moreover, we show how SPNs are able to trade accuracy for inference time by sacrificing network complexity, resulting in empirically better results.
