Each parameter of a PSDD can be viewed as the (conditional) probability of making a decision in a corresponding Sentential Decision Diagram (SDD). The SDD itself is a recently proposed complete and canonical representation of propositional theories.  We explore a number of interesting properties of PSDDs, including the independencies that underlie them.  We show that the PSDD is a tractable representation.  We further show how the parameters of a PSDD can be efficiently estimated, in closed form, from complete data.  We empirically evaluate the quality of PSDDs learned from data, when we have knowledge, a priori, of the domain logical constraints.},

  abstract = 	 {Probabilistic graphical models provide a general and flexible framework for reasoning about complex dependencies in noisy domains with many variables.  Among the various types of probabilistic graphical models, sum-product networks (SPNs) have recently generated some interest because exact inference can always be done in linear time with respect to the size of the network. This is particularly attractive since it means that learning an SPN from data always yields a tractable model for inference. However, existing parameter learning algorithms for SPNs operate in batch mode and do not scale easily to large datasets. In this work, we explore online algorithms to ensure that parameter learning can also be done tractably with respect to the amount of data.  More specifically, we propose a new Bayesian moment matching (BMM) algorithm that operates naturally in an online fashion and that can be easily distributed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of BMM in comparison to online extensions of gradient descent, exponentiated gradient and expectation maximization on 20 classic benchmarks and 4 large scale datasets.}

Existing parameter learning approaches for SPNs are largely based on the maximum likelihood principle and are subject to overfitting compared to more Bayesian approaches. Exact Bayesian posterior inference for SPNs is computationally intractable. Even approximation techniques such as standard variational inference and posterior sampling for SPNs are computationally infeasible even for networks of moderate size due to the large number of local latent variables per instance. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic collapsed variational inference algorithm for SPNs that is computationally efficient, easy to implement and at the same time allows us to incorporate prior information into the optimization formulation. Extensive experiments show a significant improvement in accuracy compared with a maximum likelihood based approach.}

We demonstrate how to access and reformat publicly available datasets in order to apply machine learning techniques. We first learn a Bayesian network in order to read independencies in linear time between bacterial community characteristics. These independencies are useful in understanding the semantic relationships between bacteria within communities. Next, we learn a Sum-Product network in order to perform inference in linear time. Here, inference can be conducted to answer traditional queries, involving posterior probabilities, or MPE queries, requesting the most likely values of the non-evidence variables given evidence. Our results extend the literature by showing that known relationships between soil bacteria holding in one or a few datasets in fact hold across at least 3500 diverse datasets. This study paves the way for future large-scale studies of agricultural, health, and environmental applications, for which data are publicly available.",

title = {Dynamic Minimization of Sentential Decision Diagrams},
year = {2013},
abstract = {The Sentential Decision Diagram (SDD) is a recently proposed representation of Boolean functions, containing Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) as a distinguished subclass. While OBDDs are characterized by total variable orders, SDDs are characterized more generally by vtrees. As both OBDDs and SDDs have canonical representations, searching for OBDDs and SDDs of minimal size simplifies to searching for variable orders and vtrees, respectively. For OBDDs, there are effective heuristics for dynamic reordering, based on locally swapping variables. In this paper, we propose an analogous approach for SDDs which navigates the space of vtrees via two operations: one based on tree rotations and a second based on swapping children in a vtree. We propose a particular heuristic for dynamically searching the space of vtrees, showing that it can find SDDs that are an order-of-magnitude more succinct than OBDDs found by dynamic reordering.},
